# Drone Strike - A Game Project
Drone Strike is a game developed during three months as a course project in the third year at Blekinge Institute of Technology.
The game, as well as the game engine it is using, is created from scratch during these three months.

## Gameplay
The game is a time based puzzle game where you as the player control an arrow in third person whose objective is to hit all the drones flying around the map. The player is awarded points based on where they hit the the drone and how fast they complete the objectives. When the objective is either completed or failed the player is presented with a replay of their attempt in a free view camera. The player can then analyze their atttempt by using the replay buttons with accompanying timeline.
